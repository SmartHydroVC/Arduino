# Introduction 
This repository is a part of the SmartHydro project, dedicated to making agriculture more efficient and sustainable through technology. 
Our goal is to leverage the power of Arduino and TinyML to create smart hydroponic systems that can create and maintain an optimal growth environment for crops

Here, you'll find the Arduino code that allows our system to:
- Spin up a local network
- Connect to a WiFi network to push the collected data online
- Control crop environment through an onboard AI model
- Allow the hardware components to be controlled through the network

## Getting Started
To use this code, you'll need an Arduino Mega 2560 and the following sensors:
- [DHT22](https://www.diyelectronics.co.za/store/humidity/3660-dht22-temperature-humidity-sensor-module-gravity-series.html?search_query=dht11&results=12)
- [Analog PH Sensor](https://www.diyelectronics.co.za/store/liquid/2253-analog-ph-sensor-pro-kit-for-arduino.html?search_query=pH+sensor&results=199)
- [YF-B6](https://www.diyelectronics.co.za/store/other/1540-water-flow-sensor-yf-b6-1-30-lmin-15-mpa.html?search_query=pump&results=34)
- [Analog Ambient Light Sensor](https://www.diyelectronics.co.za/store/light/3659-analog-ambient-light-sensor-module-gravity-series.html)
- [E-201](https://reliablestore.co.za/products/e-201-ec-electrode-electric-conductivity-meter-accessories?variant=40217068634273&sfdr_ptcid=28846_617_673354034&sfdr_hash=535fd536fa632ec0b76f8370ca9e23ee)

Then, open the Arduino IDE, load the code, and upload it to your board. For more detailed instructions on how to do this, please refer to the Arduino's official Getting Started Guide.
